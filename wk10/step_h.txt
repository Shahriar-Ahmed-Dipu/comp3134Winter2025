To mitigate the issue of displaying sensitive information like employee IDs in the HTML source code, I have replaced the HTML comments with PHP comments. PHP comments are not visible in the browser source code, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed. 
This will protect the confidentiality of employee details while still keeping the comments in the source code for developers.
