APR spoofing attacks can be mitigated by configuring static ARP entries on devices. This ensures the IP-to-MAC address mapping is fixed and cannot me modified. Also, packet filtering can be used to help detect and block ARP packets that do not match set patterns, helping prevent injected false ARP responses. Furthermore, using protocols such as SSL/TLS make it harder for intruders to intercept and modify the data.
